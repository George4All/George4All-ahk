    <h3>Initial Commit</h3>
	<p>The first commit was released on 11th September 2021. It was released in 3 parts. First was the actual commit, which included a random assortment of AHK scripts. The second part included a README.md file which was created to provide more info about the script. The third part included the removal of scripts not written by George4All and the renaming of some files.</p>
	
	<h3>2nd Commit</h3>
	<p>The second commit was released on 18th September 2021. It was released in 5 parts. The first part had the restructuring of the file system and the addition of some new scripts. Part 2 had reversed all the changes as George messed some stuff up. The third part was the first part, but without the problems there were in the initial part. The 4th part included renaming and changing the folder structure once again. The 5th part also saw the introduction of the GNU General Public License v3.0 licence.</p>
	  
	<h3>3nd Commit</h3>
