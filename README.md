# George4All-ahk

George4All-ahk is a collection of scripts written by George4All. These were inspired by [TaranVH's 2nd Keyboard Scripts](https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard).

## Naming Scheme

The naming scheme is quite akward. I tried to improve them but didn't really manage to. But, considering these are simple scripts its super easy to rename them, so that hopefully shouldn't be much of a problem
